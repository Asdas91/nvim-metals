# nvim-metals

This is a WIP [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) plugin and guide for Nvim
users utilizing the [Nvim built-in LSP
module](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html). The goal of this plugin is to
provide with the extra functionality that you need for Metals and the rest will
serve as a guide and an example.

Keep in mind that the level of support is rapidly changing, there are bugs, and
there are missing features. Some of this is changing daily, so expect stuff to
break without warning or change.

If you're first getting starting with Metals, consider using
[coc-metals](https://github.com/scalameta/coc-metals) if you're looking for a
more feature-full and stable Metals + Nvim experience.

If you're a `coc-metals` user and want to try this but are worried about
`coc.nvim` and the built-in LSP conflicting in any way, take a look at how I
handle this [in the
wiki](https://github.com/ckipp01/nvim-metals/wiki/Try-nvim-metals-without-conflicting-with-coc-metals)

## Prerequisites

Before you get started you need to ensure that you have the nightly/development
build of Nvim. LSP support hasn't landed in stable yet. You can find
instructions for how to do this for you OS
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim). It's best to
re-build often as LSP support is changing daily. The easiest way to ensure
you're on nightly is to to do a `nvim --version`. If you see anything `v0.4.x`
then it didn't work. You're looking for `v0.5.x`:

```vim
‚ùØ nvim --version
NVIM v0.5.0-3de9452
...
```

### Plugins

Apart from this plugin, you'll also want to have the
[neovim/nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) plugin installed. For now,
this plugin offers automated installation and some default configurations for
Metals.

Use whichever plugin manager to install both.
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is probably the most common, so
I'll use that as an example:

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
  " Main necessary plugins
  Plug 'neovim/nvim-lsp'
  Plug 'ckipp01/nvim-metals'
  " Complementary plugins that I recommend and will go over down below
  Plug 'haorenW1025/completion-nvim'
  Plug 'haorenW1025/diagnostic-nvim'
call plug#end()
```

## Getting started

First things first, you need to install Metals. This functionality is provided
by the [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) plugin. It offers
automated installation of servers and basic configurations so you don't have to
do it manually.

If you'd like to use a Snapshot version of metals, you can set it like below
before you do the `LspInstall`. If you've already installed, you need to remove
the installation, set this, and then install again. Hopefully this process will
be smoother in the future.

```vim
let g:metals_server_version = '0.8.4+106-5f2b9350-SNAPSHOT'
```

```vim
:LspInstall metals
```

There isn't a lot of feedback on whether or not this worked, so after you do
this, issue the following command to ensure that it's installed. This will also
show you the directory that it's installed in.

```vim
:LspInstallInfo
```

If it's installed, you should see something like the following:

```vim
{
  metals = {
    cmd = { "/Users/ckipp/.cache/nvim/nvim_lsp/metals/metals" },
    install_dir = "/Users/ckipp/.cache/nvim/nvim_lsp/metals",
    is_installed = "file"
  }
}
```

Make sure to take a look at the [`setup()`
function](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp#setup-function) which will show you
how to override certain values or add extra settings. You can see all of the
default Metals values in the [readme](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp#metals)
or checkout
[nvim-lsp/lua/nvim_lsp/metals.lua](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp/blob/master/lua/nvim_lsp/metals.lua).

If you don't want any of the extra stuff the other plugins offer, then just copy
the mappings under the [**nvim-lsp Mappings**](./nvim-lsp.vim) section to get
the mappings, add in the `autocmd` to get you completions (that you'll need to
trigger yourself without the plugin). Then you can just use the default setup
like below which uses all defaults:

```lua
require'nvim_lsp'.metals.setup{}
```

However, I recommend that you use a few related plugins for a much better
experience. If you're using extra nvim lsp plugins, they should have good
instructions, but you'd set them up like the following:

```lua
:lua << EOF
  local nvim_lsp = require'nvim_lsp'
  local M = {}
  M.on_attach = function()
      require'diagnostic'.on_attach() -- needed for the diagnostic plugin
      require'completion'.on_attach() -- needed for the completion plugin
    end
  nvim_lsp.metals.setup{
    on_attach = M.on_attach
  }
EOF
```

**Fair warning, they installation is probably all going to change.**
In you following the conversation
[here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp/issues/200), you'll notice a couple
things.

1. There is an automated way to install, but not uninstall or update
2. The install feature will probably go away

For now, this is still the best way to install Metals for Nvim.  If the Install
goes away, there is a decent chance I'll handle the Install / Uninstall / Update
right in this plugin.

## Settings and Mappings

Some very basic things are enabled by default, like in-line diagnostics, but
you'll want a basic configuration for things like finding definitions and
references. The [nvim-lsp.vim](./nvim-lsp.vim) file has examples of these along
with some settings for the other complementary plugins. _These are opinionated_,
and catered to my work flow. There are also a two other plugin settings under
`completion-nvim` and `diagnostic-nvim` headings. Those plugins, which are
outlined below must also be installed for those settings to work.  The idea of
me including this file is for you to use them as a base or an example and to
then build off of them or change them to your liking. They also serve as an
example of how to use `lua` in your configuration if you're not familiar with
them. They also have a few vim configurations that I'd argue are important for
you to not go insane (like having `set signcolumn=yes`). Again, edit this to
your liking. They are just in here as an example.

```vim
nnoremap <silent> gd <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>
nnoremap <silent> K  <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>
```

You can sort of assume what many of the mappings do, but you can find more info
on the available options by doing `:h lsp-config`. There is a lot of great info
in the `lsp` section of the docs, but also keep in mind that things are often
changing and many sections are just bare with `TODOs`.

The mappings I've included are a combination of what Metals supports and also
what Nvim LSP supports.
## Custom Mappings

If you'd like to add a custom mapping instead of using the commands, you're free
to do so. For example, let's say we wanted to add a custom mapping for
`BuildImport`, you could by doing the following:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <leader>bi  <cmd>lua require'metals'.build_import()<CR>
```

This would allow you to do `<leader>bi` to trigger an import, the same way
`:BuildImport` does.

## Available Commands

Currently, the following commands are available:

Command             |Description
--------------------|-------------------------------------
`:BuildImport`      | Import the build
`:BuildConnect`     | Manually connect to the build server
`:BuildRestart`     | Restart the build server
`:CompileCascade`   | Compile current open file along with all build targets that depend on it
`:Format`           | Format current buffer **Make sure to have a .scalafmt.conf**
`:MetalsDoctor`     | Run Metals Doctor, which will open in your browser
`:MetalsLogsToggle` | Opens the embedded terminal to view metals logs
`:SourcesScan`      | Scan all workspace sources

## Custom Functions

Custom functions are similar to Custom Callbacks in that you use them to
override a default setup option for Metals.

Currently if you use a build definition structure with multiple nested build
files, the Nvim LSP client will re-initialize when you go into a module with
another build file. In order to prevent this, use the `metals.root_pattern()`
function to override the `root_dir` function like below:

```lua
local metals = require'metals'
nvim_lsp.metals.setup{
  root_dir = metals.root_pattern("build.sbt", "build.sc");
}
```

This `root_pattern()` function is almost identical to the one that is in
`nvim-lsp`, but it adds in the ability to check to ensure that there isn't
another build file in the parent directory. *If you are only using nvim-metals
with projects that only ever have one build file, then there is no need to set
this.*

## Custom Callbacks

The Nvim LSP module heavily relies on callback for each type of message that it
receives from the server. These can all be overridden and customized. You can
either override them globally, or just for Metals. An example of global override
using one of the custom callbacks nvim-metals provides would look like this:

```lua
local metals = require'metals'
lsp.callbacks['textDocument/hover'] = metals.hover_wrap
```

Example usage for only Metals:
```lua
local metals = require'metals'
nvim_lsp.metals.setup{
  callbacks = {
    ["textDocument/hover"] = metals.hover_wrap
  }
}
```

Currently, the following callbacks are available:

Callback            |Description
--------------------|-------------------------------------
`hover_wrap()`      | The default floating window for hovers do not wrap for long text. This hover implementation will wrap for you.
`metals_status()`   | Used as a callback to enable `metals/status`. In order to use this, you need to make sure you also override `statusBarProvider` to `on` in your `init_options`.

## Statusline integration

The Nvim LSP module provides some useful functions out of the box for you to
customize what is shown in your statusline. Mainly,
`:h lsp.util.buf_diagnostics_count`. They also provide a full example there.
What I do in order to show warnings and errors in my statusline is the 
the following:

```vim
" I re-utilize the signs that you may have already set for
" `LspDiagnosticsErrorSign`, and if not give you defaults which are
" displayed before the error total.
function! LspErrors() abort
  let errorCount = luaeval('vim.lsp.util.buf_diagnostics_count("Error")')
  if (errorCount > 0)
    let possibleLspSign = sign_getdefined("LspDiagnosticsErrorSign")
    let sign = get(possibleLspSign, 0, {"text": "E"})
    return sign.text . errorCount
  else
    return ''
  endif
endfunction
```
Then when I'm setting my statusline, I have the following:

```vim
...
set statusline+=%#StatusLineError#%{LspErrors()}\ " LSP Errors
set statusline+=%#StatusLineWarning#%{LspWarnings()}%#StatusLine#\ " LSP Warnings
...
```

You can see that I also have custom highlight groups that surround them. You can
do this all in one function, two functions, etc. Customize it to your liking.
For me, I like a minimal statusline, so having this setup looks like this:

![Statusline](https://i.imgur.com/y4hij0S.png)

You can also enable
[`metals/status`](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/new-editor.html#metalsstatus)
which will allow for you to use the `metals#status()` function in your
statusline to show the status messages coming from Metals. This can be used like
the below example or added into an existing statusline integration:

```vim
...
set statusline+=%{metals#status()}\ " metals/status
...
```

## Complementary Plugins

I've listed two external plugins in the examples that help the diagnostic and
completion experience. The Nvim LSP integration exposes a bunch of callbacks
that allow for easy customization. As far as I know the idea isn't to make an
extremely polished experience out of the box with Nvim LSP, but rather offer a
solid core that allows you to define custom callbacks for how you want to handle
these things. The idea is that this plugin will offer you all the necessary
Metals specific settings, while also allowing other plugins to offer the thing
they do best. This follows the [Unix
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of tools doing one
thing, doing them well, and interfacing well with others.

### Completions

Taken from the docs:

> Nvim provides the _vim.lsp.omnifunc_ 'omnifunc' handler which allows
_i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O_ to consume LSP completion. Example config (note the use of
_v:lua_ to call Lua from Vimscript):

```vim
" Use LSP omni-completion in Scala files.
autocmd Filetype scala setlocal omnifunc=v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc
```

This will give you completion in Scala files, but you'd need to trigger them
using `i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O`, which you may not want. This is why I include the
following plugin:

- [completion-nvim](https://github.com/haorenW1025/completion-nvim)

```vim
Plug 'haorenW1025/completion-nvim'
```
This plugin will give you completion automatically in the floating window as
your typing. I have a few other settings listed which allow you to use `<Tab>`
to navigate the popup menu.

### Diagnostics

The diagnostics plugin I include mainly allows for easy settings and
customization for how your diagnostics are displayed. For example you can delay
the syntactic diagnostics that Metals provides while typing when you're in
insert mode. You can choose to display them as virtual text or not. Read through
the docs to get an idea of all the options.

- [diagnostic-nvim](https://github.com/haorenW1025/diagnostic-nvim)

```vim
Plug 'haorenW1025/diagnostic-nvim'
```

**Keep in mind that both of these plugins are under active development as well
and things are likely to change**.


## Importing your build

**You need to do this before any Metals functionality will work**

Since `window/showMessageRequest` is not yet supported in the nvim LSP module,
you need to trigger this manually. As you would normally, open your project and
then issue a `:BuildImport` command which will send the request to Metals to
import your build.

## Known limitations

- There is no `window/showMessageRequest` so you'll never get prompted to import
    your build. Another issue is that if you do a `:Format` request and don't have
    a .scalafmt.conf file, it will error out. There is an issue for this here:
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11710
- Multiline `textEdits` aren't being applied correctly. You can track this
    issue here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12195
- `textDocument/codeAction` is not yet supported. You can follow the progress
    here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11607
- The Quickfix List opens at times in an odd position (to the bottom right of
    your viewport). You can follow a feature request to discuss this here:
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12241
- `additionalTextEdits` are not taken into account in `CompletionItem`. In
    Metals this means things like the `s` getting added in front of a string
    during a completion to make it an interpolated string won't work as
    expected. You can follow this issue here:
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12310

## Troubleshooting

If you're using the built-in LSP support you may have to do a bit of
troubleshooting. It may not always be easy to tell if the issue is coming from
missing LSP support or misconfiguration between Metals and Nvim. Here are a
couple pointers on tracking down the issue.

- Use `:MetalsLogsToggle` which will open the embedded Nvim terminal tailing the
    `.metals/metals.log` file. Take a look in there for something odd. More than
    likely if something isn't working, it will have blown up and you'll see a
    hint here.
- If you see an error flash in your terminal and you want to see what it was,
    `:messages` is your friend to find it.
- Read through the [Known Limitation](#known-limitations) again to make sure
    it's not something that is documented not working.
- If you really want to get deep into debugging, create a [JSON-RPC trace
    file](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/contributors/getting-started.html#json-rpc-trace)
    and then you can `tail` the communication between the Nvim LSP client the
    Metals server.
- When in doubt, just submit and issue, and we'll dive in together.
