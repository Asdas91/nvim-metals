INTRODUCTION						                                    *metals-introdction*

nvim-metals is a plugin built to provide a better experience while using Metals,
the Scala Language Server with Neovim's built-in LSP support. This plugin offers
extras helpers that allow you to import your build, use specific Metals LSP
extensions, and provide an overall smoother experience than using Metals and
plain built-in LSP support with Neovim.
